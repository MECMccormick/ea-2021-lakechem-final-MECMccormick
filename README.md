# ea-2021-lakechem-final-MECMccormick
A repo for my final project for CU Boulder Earth Lab's Earth Analytics Certificate course.

My blog submission is the file titled 'ea-2021-alpine-lakechem-blog-MECMccormick.ipynb'. The file containing the code used to generate the figures for the blog is 'ea-2021-spring-lakechem-final-MECM.ipynb'. It is a cleaned version of the 'working document' notebook titled 'ea-2021-lakechem-proj-MECM.ipynb'. The lake chemistry data are not yet published, but will be via the USFS following federal guidelines. I have made the version I'm working with available in this repo. Please contact me if you have any issues accessing it in order to run the python scripts.
